# Superjoin Hiring Assignment

### Welcome to Superjoin's hiring assignment! üöÄ

### Objective
Build a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement
Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. Your task is to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.

### Requirements:
1. Real-time Synchronisation
  - Implement a system that detects changes in Google Sheets and updates the database accordingly.
   - Similarly, detect changes in the database and update the Google Sheet.
  2.	CRUD Operations
   - Ensure the system supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Google Sheets and the database.
   - Maintain data consistency across both platforms.
   
### Optional Challenges (This is not mandatory):
1. Conflict Handling
- Develop a strategy to handle conflicts that may arise when changes are made simultaneously in both Google Sheets and the database.
- Provide options for conflict resolution (e.g., last write wins, user-defined rules).
    
2. Scalability: 	
- Ensure the solution can handle large datasets and high-frequency updates without performance degradation.
- Optimize for scalability and efficiency.

## Submission ‚è∞
The timeline for this submission is: **Next 2 days**

Some things you might want to take care of:
- Make use of git and commit your steps!
- Use good coding practices.
- Write beautiful and readable code. Well-written code is nothing less than a work of art.
- Use semantic variable naming.
- Your code should be organized well in files and folders which is easy to figure out.
- If there is something happening in your code that is not very intuitive, add some comments.
- Add to this README at the bottom explaining your approach (brownie points üòã)
- Use ChatGPT4o/o1/Github Co-pilot, anything that accelerates how you work üí™üèΩ. 

Make sure you finish the assignment a little earlier than this so you have time to make any final changes.

Once you're done, make sure you **record a video** showing your project working. The video should **NOT** be longer than 120 seconds. While you record the video, tell us about your biggest blocker, and how you overcame it! Don't be shy, talk us through, we'd love that.

We have a checklist at the bottom of this README file, which you should update as your progress with your assignment. It will help us evaluate your project.

- [ ] My code's working just fine! ü•≥
- [ ] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [ ] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [ ] I have even solved some edge cases (brownie points) üí™
- [ ] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú

## Got Questions‚ùì
Feel free to check the discussions tab, you might get some help there. Check out that tab before reaching out to us. Also, did you know, the internet is a great place to explore? üòõ

Blockers:
1. Understanding the google sheet api , like the auth overcome this by reading the doc and doing research , experiments
2. Sync logic , broke it down into smaller chunks , used a lot of console.log to identify the object structures and using google scripts triggers
3. handling deletion from sheets to db was quite a blockhead , as the data gets deleted first and then the event is triggered, so had to come the other way , then compared the ids present in sheets with the db to figureout deletion
4. for realtime mech added event listeners and polling , was a bit-hard from sheets side, as the triggers are native.

Approach:
For synchronization,  used Google Apps Script to trigger data sync when a cell in the Google Sheet was edited.
On the database side,  made a PostgreSQL trigger  to listen for changes in the database and sync them back to Google Sheets.
 implemented logic to ensure that changes in either Google Sheets or the PostgreSQL database would automatically reflect in the other and also take minimal resources and calls.
For deletions,checked if a row in Google Sheets was empty, triggering an update in the database
